We have a variety of programs that are taking off in our schools and we need positive adult role models to help make these programs happen! Share your passion for healthy food, kids, and education by volunteering with EATS for one of the following programs:\\nCooking Classes\\nDo you want to help Park City students take ownership over their healthy food choices? Our highest need for volunteers is at our elementary and middle school cooking classes. Come assist our instructors in providing the most enriching, nutritional, education experience we can offer to Park City youth. As a volunteer at our cooking classes, you’ll get the chance to prepare and eat a nourishing recipe made from scratch with students. No prior cooking experience necessary - just bring yourself and a positive attitude! We’ll provide the aprons, food, and equipment.\\nSchool Gardens\\nDo you believe that students should understand where their food comes from? Studies show that children who grow their own food are more likely to eat fruits and vegetables as an adult. Gardening also helps students learn valuable social and interpersonal skills that translate in and out of the classroom. Our indoor hydroponic systems mean that our garden program runs year round! Come get your hands dirty by volunteering to work at one of our schools' gardens.\\nEvents\\nHeading to a community event in Park City? Chances are EATS will be there with a table or booth! Volunteer with EATS at community events like Hike4Hunger or film screenings to help spread the word about EATS’ work in the community.\\nConsult with Us!\\nEATS relies on a network of professionals in Park City and beyond to help us operate at our best. From nutritionists, professional chefs, event planners, and educators to those who work in the financial services sector. They serve on our board committees - Events, Curriculum, Marketing, Development - or provide general consul on our work.

              "      <td>The Huffington Post, July 3, 2013\\nTurtle Derbies: A Race Our Turtles (and Children) Can't Win\\nBy Collette Adkins Giese\\nEvery summer in small towns across America, children search woods and waters for turtles to compete in annual turtle races, longstanding traditions that often raise money for important causes.\\nBut our nation's turtles are now dying off at alarming rates never-before seen, and it's time to end this tradition, which threatens to spread deadly diseases to both wild turtles and children.\\nAfter the races are over, most people release their turtles into the wild, undoubtedly thinking that no harm has been done. But races can expose turtles to disease, which then can spread to wild populations when turtles are released.\\nThreats like overexploitation and habitat loss have caused dramatic population declines in almost all U.S. turtle species, with many now either protected as endangered under the Endangered Species Act or under consideration for such protection. A new and emerging threat is a deadly wildlife disease called ranavirus that has caused turtle, frog and salamander die-offs in more than 25 states.\\nRanavirus infection has been confirmed in Maryland in wild eastern box turtles, a popular entrant for turtle races in the Northeast. One confirmed case of the disease showed up last summer in Harford County, home of the Bel Air Annual Turtle Derby -- one of Maryland's largest turtle races.\\nTurtle races can also spread Salmonella to people who handle turtles, including young children who can become severely ill or even die. Salmonella are naturally occurring bacteria in turtles, and infected turtles usually do not appear sick in any way.\\nThat's why the Center for Biological Diversity has asked the sponsor of the annual turtle race in Bel Air, Maryland to stop using wild caught turtles. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources also issued a statement advising against using wild caught turtles in races.\\nDespite the risks, the Bel Air Turtle Derby has explained that they will go ahead with their turtle race as planned on the Fourth of July. But hopefully this year will be the last time that wild turtles are used.\\nTurtle races strain native turtle populations that are already under terrible pressure from habitat loss, road kill and other threats. In fact, a recent study found that nearly half of all turtle species are at risk of extinction. Some turtle species have lost more than 95 percent of their historic habitat.\\nWhile many of the threats facing wild turtles are difficult problems to solve, the threat posed by turtle races has an easy fix: just stop using wild caught turtles.\\nMany small towns across the country have replaced their turtle races with wildlife-friendly festivals that use creative substitutes for wild caught turtles, such as river races using rubber turtles or races where people pull toy turtles on strings. The John Hopkins Turtle Race in Baltimore does not use any wild caught turtles, instead racing turtles brought in from U.S. turtle farms, to which the turtles are returned.\\nFor generations, that magical moment when many a child first understood our bond with all things wild was kindled by staring into the eyes of a small turtle as it crawled across their outstretched hand.\\nThat bond now requires that we put our own traditions aside and do what's best for our turtles, before it's too late.\\n© 2013 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.\\nThis article originally appeared here.</td>\n",

Needless to say, our vehicles have a lot of stories to tell.\\nThe Mahindra Adventure fleet comprises of various Mahindra 4WDs. But it is the Mahindra Scorpio VLX 4WD that forms the backbone of our fleet. When you arrive to drive, it is the Mahindra Scorpio that becomes your home for the next few days. The easiest way to recognise Mahindra Adventure vehicles is by the characteristic orange stripes of the Mahindra logo on the sides. And if you see one with headlights on, watch out because the expedition convoy is on the way.\\nMahindra Thar CRDe 4x4\\nThe Mahindra Thar combines the legendary off-road ability of the MM540 with the modern drivetrain of the Mahindra Scorpio. You will usually find them in the front and back of the convoy ensuring your safety and providing some vital automotive eye candy throughout the expedition. They’ve been customised appropriately for the kind of rough use they go through. We promise when you look at our Thars, you’ll want one. We also have specially prepared Mahindra Thars that you can drive at the Mahindra Adventure Off-Road Training Academy.\\nMahindra Scorpio VLX 4WD\\nThe Scorpio forms the backbone of our fleet and these are the ones you pilot on our expeditions. All our Scorpios are top-end VLX.\\nMahindra Bolero SLX 4x4\\nThe ubiquitous Mahindra Bolero is no stranger to India. You’ve seen them running around in every corner of the country. But our Boleros are special, first they are 4x4s which are rare and they are SLX trim 4x4s which aren’t available any more so they are a little exclusive too. The Boleros do duty as support vehicles in the Great Escapes and the Mahindra Adventure Rally team. They are also used on shorter expeditions like Authentic Goa where you could get a chance to behind the wheel of this truly rugged workhorse.\\nMahindra XUV5OO W8 AWD\\nThe cheetahs as we lovingly call them are used for official duties during the expeditions. All our XUV5OOs are top-of-the-line W8 AWD. We knock them about not only during the expeditions but also follow the rally routes during the Indian Rally Championship (IRC) and other raid-rally events. 140bhp worth of mHawk ensures we get there almost as quickly as our rally cars.\\nMahindra Getaway 4WD.\\nMahindra SuperXUV5OO\\nYou’ll hardly ever see them unless you open a newspaper and see their exploits in rallies around the country. The current INRCSUV champion has been running rings around lighter, petrol-powered competition ever since it hit the scene. It may slightly resemble the domesticated XUV5OO that you’ll see during the expedition, but underneath these special cheetahs have lots of goodies. If you ever see a blur of orange and silver on a rally stage, it’s probably a SuperXUV5OO on its way to the podium. These mean machines are piloted by the best drivers in the business – Gaurav Gill, Sunny Sidhu and Amittrajit Ghosh.\\nMahindra Navistar Truxo 25.\\nSpecial Vehicles Unit\\nThe special vehicles unit comprises of vehicles which we use during expeditions, rallies and off-road events. These vehicles have their own names and personalities and are far from standard. We lovingly maintain them and keep them away from prying eyes. Ask for their keys at your own risk. We’re a nasty bunch when it comes to these vehicles.\\nAdventure One\\nThis is what the Chief of Adventure Initiatives – Bijoykumar.Y drives. It’s a 2011 Mahindra Thar fitted with a rally cabin. Finished in matt British racing green and some tasteful white stripes along with purposeful Maxxis Bighorn 764s, Adventure One not only looks the part but also goes like stink. Mostly found in lead position during expeditions. If you see this around, rest assured ‘chief’ has one eye on her.\\nBaby\\nBaby is one of the newest Mahindra Thars. Made its first appearance on the pages of BBC TopGear magazine in 2012. She’s built not only to off-road but also lead expeditions. Chipped, lifted and equipped with a hardtop and locking rear differential, Baby is more than capable of climbing lots of stuff you’d only dream of otherwise. Maintained by Vinod Nookala – Brand Manager Thar, she can be spotted pulling people out of trouble during the numerous Mahindra Great Escapes around the country.\\nBlackie\\nA veteran of the Himalayas, this 2011 Mahindra Thar and has the title of being the most tweaked Thar in India today. We lovingly call her Blackie thanks to her matte black paintjob. Most of her bodywork is fibreglass. Apart from the regular chipping, lifting, she’s also the only Thar in India with a coil spring rear suspension. She’s one of the few Thars that run on road-biased tyres since her duty is only to lead the convoys to Ladakh. We have a hardtop on her as well as a rally exhaust. So she’s loud, so loud that you have to wear ear plugs when you drive. Ask Manish Sarser – Head of the Off-Road Training Academy who swears he hears less on one side. Do anything but don’t ask him for the keys.\\nSuper Thar / Thar mHawk\\nThese two are rarely seen. The Super Thar is the rally version of the Thar. Much on the same lines as the SuperXUV5OO. She runs rally-spec suspension along with many other goodies which we can’t tell you about. Because we’d have to kill you if we told you. The Thar mHawk is also one of a kind. Don’t start jumping, it’s not coming into production…yet. Both are finished in traditional orange and white, consider yourself lucky if you ever get to see one of these.</td>\n",

Miller Holdings, Inc.\\nDoug Miller and his son signed a broad noncompetition agreement when Doug sold his fuel-additives business, E.T., in 2011. Doug sold his other company, Petroleum Solutions, to Kuhns about a year later. E.T.’s new owners sued the Millers for breaching the noncompete by providing assistance to Kuhns as he learned the Petroleum Solutions business. The Millers claimed the noncompete was overbroad and unenforceable and that their assistance to Kuhns came at a time when Petroleum Solutions was E.T.’s distributor, not its competitor. When E.T. severed its relationship with Petroleum Solutions in 2012, Doug told Kuhns that the noncompetition agreement prevented further help and ceased assisting him. On summary judgment, the district judge held that the noncompetition agreement was enforceable but the Millers did not breach it. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, agreeing that the contract was not overbroad, but that the Millers did not breach it. A company’s distributor is not its competitor, so the Millers’ assistance to Kuhns in 2012 was \"fair game.\" The contract, read reasonably, did not require Doug to break his preexisting lease with Kuhns.

View \"Right Field Rooftops, LLC v. Chicago Cubs Baseball Club, LLC\" on Justia Law\\nLand O’Lakes, Inc. v. Ratajczak\\nFrom 2006-2012 Packerland deceived at least one of its customers about the protein content of its Whey Protein Concentrate. Land O’Lakes purchased Packerland’s protein concentrate for use in making foods for calves and other young animals. Buyers infer protein levels from measuring nitrogen: a seller can add another nitrogen-rich substance to produce higher scores. The Ratajczaks, who owned Packerland, started adding urea to its protein concentrate. in 2006. Land O’Lakes suspected that the concentrate was high in nonprotein nitrogen but could not learn why; the Ratajczaks made excuses that Land O’Lakes accepted. The Ratajczaks sold Packerland in 2012. The new owner kept them as employees; they kept adding urea until the buyer learned what the truth. The Ratajczaks lost their jobs and settled for about $10 million before the buyer filed a complaint. Land O’Lakes stopped buying Packerland’s product and asserted claims of breach of contract, fraud, and violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Packerland’s insurers refused to defend or indemnify it or the Ratajczaks; the Ratajczaks’ personal insurer refused to indemnify them for their settlement with Packerland’s buyer. The district court dismissed Land O’Lakes’s suit and ruled in favor of the insurers. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, rejecting Land O’Lakes’ claim to treble damages under RICO and state-law and the Ratajczaks’ claims that Packerland’s insurers and their own insurers had to defend and indemnify them.

Volvo Trucks North America\\nIn 2010, Mohr and Volvo entered into a heavy truck dealership agreement. In 2012, Volvo sought a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to terminate Mohr’s dealership because Mohr had misrepresented that it would build a new long‐term facility for the dealership. Mohr complained that Volvo had violated Indiana’s Franchise Disclosure and Deceptive Franchise Practices Acts by promising to award Mohr a Mack Truck dealership franchise, which would have justified Mohr’s investment in the new facility. Volvo gave the Mack franchise to another company. Mohr also accused Volvo of providing more favorable concessions on truck pricing to other franchise dealerships through its Retail Sales Assistance program. The district court granted summary judgment, holding that the integration clause in the dealer agreement barred the new‐facility claim and the Mack franchise claim. Following a trial on the unfair discrimination claim, a jury awarded Mohr $6.5 million. The Seventh Circuit reversed the award for the unfair discrimination claim and affirmed the summary judgment rulings. The court stated that these were sophisticated parties, bound by the integration clause and that Mohr did not establish unfair discrimination with respect to price concessions.

              "      <td>Potatoes are a nutritious starchy vegetable.\\nThe way you prepare your potatoes will determine how nutritious they are, but all types of potatoes can be a healthy source of fiber and essential nutrients when prepared and served with little or no added fat. Different types of potatoes have slightly different nutritional compositions, but sweet potatoes have a slight advantage since they provide higher amounts of a number of essential vitamins and minerals.\\nMacronutrients\\nA 100-gram serving of baked white potatoes, red skin potatoes or sweet potatoes with skin contains between 89 and 94 calories and provides 2 grams of protein and 20 to 21 grams of carbohydrate. Both protein and carbohydrates provide your body with energy, and protein also provides essential amino acids for forming new cells in the body. White potato and red skin potato provide 2 grams of fiber per serving, and sweet potato provides 3 grams of fiber per serving toward the recommended daily fiber intake of between 21 and 38 grams, depending on your age and gender. Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that is important for healthy digestive function and can lower your risk for obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol and heart disease.\\nVitamins\\nSweet potatoes provide 19,218 international units of vitamin A per 100-gram serving, which is 440 percent of the daily value for vitamin A. This is significantly more than white or red skin potatoes, which contain only 10 international units. Vitamin A is essential for healthy vision, cell division and immune function. Sweet potatoes also provide more vitamin C, with a serving providing 20 milligrams, or 40 percent of the DV, compared to the 13 milligrams found in a serving of white or red skin potatoes. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that is needed for building and repairing cells in your body. All three types of potato contain 4 percent of the DV for folate. Sweet potatoes contain more riboflavin, providing 8 percent of the DV compared to the 2 percent of the DV in white and red skin potatoes.\\nMinerals\\nSweet potatoes contain more calcium than red skin and white potatoes, but red skin and white potatoes provide more magnesium. A 100-gram serving of sweet potatoes contains 4 percent of the daily value for calcium and 6 percent of the daily value for magnesium, compared to the trace amounts of calcium and 8 percent of the daily value for magnesium provided by red skin and white potatoes. Calcium and magnesium are both important for strong bones and nerve and muscle function. All three types of potatoes contain about the same amount of phosphorus, zinc and iron, providing 6 percent of the daily value for phosphorus and 2 percent of the daily value for zinc and iron per 100-gram serving.\\nConsiderations\\nBaking is one of the healthier methods for cooking potatoes. Instead of butter or sour cream, consider topping your potato with vegetarian chili, yogurt or broccoli with low-fat cheese. Eat the skin as well as the flesh, as this is the most nutrient-dense part of the potato. Avoid eating any part of the potato that has green skin or new growth, as these parts contain a bitter toxin.\\nArticles For Your Diet\\nReferences (7)\\n- USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory: Nutrient Data for 11357, Potatoes, White, Flesh and Skin, Baked\\n- USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory: Nutrient Data for 11358, Potatoes, Red, Flesh and Skin, Baked\\n- USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory: Nutrient Data for 11508, Sweet Potato, Cooked, Baked in Skin, Without Salt\\n- Texas A&amp;M Extension: What Is the Difference Between a Sweet Potato and a Yam?\\n- Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Is Potato Skin the Most Nutritious Part of Potatoes?\\n- University of Florida Extension: Growing Potatoes in the Florida Home Garden\\n- Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Bring Back the Potato\\nPhoto Credits\\n- Sweet Potatoes and New Potatoes in Baskets image by bawinner from Fotolia.com</td>\n",

Please e-mail your U.S. Representative and ask him or her to VOTE YES on the comp time bill, H.R. 1180.\\nIn February, Representative Martha Roby (R-Ala.), introduced the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017 (H.R. 1180) also known as the “comp time” bill. The proposal will remove a federal restriction on the private-sector and help Americans better address family and work needs. H.R. 1180 would permit – but would NOT require – private-sector employers to offer employees the choice of taking overtime in cash payments as they do currently or in the form of paid time off – or comp time.\\nThe House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections held a legislative hearing on H.R. 1180 on April 5th. SHRM members Leslie Christ, Chief Resource Officer for WellStone Behavioral Health, and Crystal Frey, Vice President of Human Resources for Continental Realty Corporation, testified at the hearing in support of the bill. H.R. 1180 is expected to go before the full House of Representatives for a vote the week of May 1st.\\nSHRM supports H.R. 1180 and we need your help! Please e-mail your U.S. Representative and ask him or her to vote “YES” for H.R. 1180 when the proposal goes to the House floor. Read SHRM’s position paper on the comp bill.\\nPLEASE TAKE THIS ACTION\\nE-mail your Representative’s Washington, DC office using SHRM’s Policy Action Center by following these fast and easy steps:\\n- Visit SHRM’s Policy Action Center\\n- Fill out your contact information (be sure to enter your home mailing address since the system will correctly match you to your federal congressional district).\\n- Personalize the template email language to include your message with your own story.\\n- Click “submit.”\\nIt is critical that Representatives hear from employers in their congressional districts over the next five days leading into the week of May 1st. That’s why we are asking you – HR professionals, to e-mail your House members and express support for the comp time legislation.\\nBACKGROUND\\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 requires that hours of work by non-exempt employees beyond 40 hours in a seven-day period must be compensated at a rate of 1 1/2. 1180 1/2 hours for each hour of overtime worked. Employees would be able to accrue up to 160 hours of comp time per year, although an employer could choose to “cash out” the comp time after 80 hours after providing the employee with 30 days of notice. An employer would also be required to cash out any unused comp time at year’s end at the regular time and a half rate.\\nFor questions regarding compensatory time and Rep. Roby’s comp time bill, contact Patrick Brady, SHRM’s Senior Government Affairs Advisor, at Patrick.Brady@shrm.org or 703-535-6246.\\nIf you encounter any issues contacting your member of Congress, please contact Meredith Nethercutt, SHRM’s Senior Associate, Member Advocacy and A-Team Program Director, at Meredith.Nethercutt@shrm.org or (703) 535-6417.</td>\n",

You see we live rurally, we have a small block of shops – a butcher, 2 dairies/corner store, a café, hairdresser, 2 bakeries, chemist, post shop, petrol station and a pub – yep, that is about it!\\nImagine this…\\nIf all of us in our small community went to the heart of Auckland city for haircuts, our petrol, our prescriptions etc… the ultimate result would be our ‘local’ shops and enterprises would close.\\nNow, ponder the concept in our beautiful industry….\\nAnswer this question – If none of the locals shopped in your store would your business survive?\\nFor most of us in retail, unless we have an incredible online presence, and one that is globally recognised and very successful – the answer is NO!\\nSo we can all agree that ‘Local’ is important right!\\nNext question – Look at your stock and your supply chain …\\nHow much of it is local?\\nYes, from your town, your city, your country, your hemisphere – New Zealand and Australia..\\nDo you make a conscious effort to support suppliers from your own community/country first?\\nHave you ever thought about considering the ‘local’ supplier over a big international player?\\nWhat happens if we don’t support ‘local’ – easy, they disappear! And, if the locals don’t support you, then the chances are you will disappear.\\nThere are 3 reasons why I love LOCAL:\\n- I can build a personal relationship with my customers and my supply chain. They understand my market and my business model.\\n- It is more cost and time effective to deal with local suppliers – I don’t have the same freight charges, customs, import costs and time delays with delivery.\\n- It is a two way street – I support local and local support me.\\nThe surprising fact is that when I have made a conscious effort to look for local suppliers, I have found in a number of cases something more brilliant than I could have found by going off shore.\\nBut, then I am an individual, I don’t need to follow what everyone else does. I don’t need to have the same, look and behave the same, I am comfortable in my skin being different. I love being individual, different and of cause I love being ‘local.\\nI want to aggravate and agitate your thought process around ‘Local’…\\nSo, how ‘local’ are you?\\nAre your shoppers ‘local’?\\nHow dependent are you on ‘local’ for your revenue stream?\\nDo you support your ‘local’ community?\\nDo you engage with your ‘local’ supply chain?\\nDo you choose ‘local’ over international suppliers?\\nHere is one of my challenges to you for 2018:\\n- When you need a supply chain – think ‘local’ first\\n- When you work on growing your business, think local first – what does your local community want and where would they most appreciate the supply from\\n- Make contributing to ‘local’ part of your DNA – give back to your local communities\\nFor me, yes – proud to be ‘Local’\\nSee you in your local area sometime soon!\\nThought for today:\\n-Kevin Kruse\\nFondest Regards\\nHelen</td>\n",

              "      <td>Just in time for Valentine’s Day, I’ve learned why I’m so bad at romance.\\nApparently, to succeed, you have to work really hard.\\nThat’s the word from three romance novelists, all of whom appeared Saturday at the Camden County Library in Voorhees.\\nI interviewed the authors, expecting to chat about ripped bodices, heaving bosoms and throbbing ... um ... passions. But I quickly learned they were committed to a labor of love — with the emphasis on labor.\\n“There was a time when writers could just sit down and write,” said Tina Gabrielle of Cinnaminson, who’s set five romances in 19th century England. “Today, we have to have blogs and we tweet and we Facebook. We try to promote the book without forcing it down somebody’s throat.”\\n“It’s almost like having two full-time jobs,” added Kathleen Long, a Cherry Hill author of 15 books.\\nIndeed, these days, writers don’t just craft fictitious characters.\\nConsider the website for Terri Brisbin of Berlin Borough, who’s written more than 30 books about love in long-ago Scotland. It shows a castle rising dramatically in a Highlands setting, the scene tinted purple by a gathering dusk. Two gleaming swords stretch beneath Brisbin’s name and what might be a racy royal motto: “Compelling, sexy historical romance.”\\n“An author today is a platform and a brand,” explained Brisbin. “It’s a career, not a hobby.”\\nNow, I didn’t have time to read their books, but the titles are just great.\\nBrisbin’s “Yield to the Highlander” suggests an intriguing twist to traffic rules in Glasgow. And a series by Gabrielle proceeds from “In the Barrister’s Chambers” to “In the Barrister’s Bed.” Up next, I bet: “Watching the Barrister Sleep.”\\nThe covers are pretty dramatic, too.\\nFor instance, I hadn’t realized Scotland’s climate is so mild that men there can wear kilts and nothing else — unless you count the occasional straps that barely restrain their rippling muscles.\\n“There’s nothing wrong with a man in a kilt,” declared Brisbin, 58, who’s sold more than 1.7 million copies of her works. “Clearly it resonates with women.”\\nBrisbin has repeatedly visited Scotland to ensure her books are authentic. On her latest trip, in 2009, she traveled alone through the countryside for more than three weeks.\\nI’d like to think at some point her car broke down on a lonely moor. Then, a rugged but sensitive fellow emerged from the heather to help guide her on the path to self-discovery. Call that one “The Kilt Whisperer.”\\nGabrielle — a former mechanical engineer who also worked as an attorney before her first book debuted in 2009 — conducts much of her research in libraries and online. “I’ve traveled a lot, but I’ve never been to London in the 1800s,” she explained.\\nHer website notes Gabrielle’s offered workshops to aspiring writers, giving tips on how to pitch a book and land a contract. One of her topics would not interest romance-novel coverboys: “How to use conflict to get past the dreaded sagging middle.”\\n“There are even workshops we can take on how to write and think like a man,” said Gabrielle, 42. OK, but you could just drink heavily and get the same effect.\\nThe writers say their genre has a few guidelines — heroes should be underdogs; heroines, plucky and determined — but only one unbreakable rule.\\nLove conquers all.\\n“It has to have the happily ever after — always. That’s what women want,” said Gabrielle.\\nBut even that commandment might be tweaked under the right circumstances, suggests Brisbin. “Generally, if they end up dying, it’s not a romance — unless they’re dead and paranormal.”\\nThe workload becomes even more challenging when an author’s own romance results in children.\\n“I used to be a morning writer,” said Long, 50, whose schedule changed with her daughter’s birth eight years ago. “I’ve learned to write at night — and my brain is definitely a morning brain.”\\nGabrielle, who has two young daughters, shares that view. At her website, the writer says she’s learned “to grab time and use it when I can” on nights and weekends.\\n“That being said, I do have a publishing contract (that) requires me to complete a 100,000-word manuscript ... in less than a year.”\\nIt all sounds so grueling I’m tempted to cry out: “Wake up and smell the tea, m’lady! Too much ardor can make ye a martyr!“\\nBut only a guy would think less is amour.\\n“I wouldn’t be writing romance if I didn’t love it,” Gabrielle assured me. “It’s been happily-ever-after, at least so far.”\\nJim Walsh’s column runs Mondays. Reach him at jwalsh@gannett.com.\\nIf you go\\n• A romance author event will be held at 1 p.m. Saturday at the Vogelson Regional Branch Library, 203 Laurel Road, Voorhees. The program will include chocolate tasting and door prizes.

            "THE RISE and rise of the Australian strawberry, raspberry and blackberry industries has seen the sectors redouble their international trade focus, with the release of a dedicated export plan to grow their global presence over the next 10 years.\n",
            "Driven by significant grower input, the Berry Export Summary 2028 maps the sectors’ current position, where they want to be, high-opportunity markets and next steps.\n",
            "Hort Innovation trade manager Jenny Van de Meeberg said the value and volume of raspberry and blackberry exports rose by 100 per cent between 2016 and 2017. She said the Australian strawberry industry experienced similar success with an almost 30 per cent rise in export volume and a 26 per cent rise in value to $32.6M over the same period.\n",
            "“Australian berry sectors are in a firm position at the moment,” she said. “Production, adoption of protected substrate cropping, improved genetics and an expanding geographic footprint have all helped put Aussie berries on a positive trajectory.\n",
            "“We are seeing a real transition point. Broad industry interest and a strong commercial appetite for export market development combined with the potential to capitalise on existing trade agreements and build new trade partnerships has created this perfect environment for growth.”\n",
            "High-income countries across Europe, North America and Northern Asia have been identified as having a palate for Australian grown berries with more than 4244 tonnes of fresh berries exported in the last financial year alone.\n",
            "The strategy identified the best short-term prospect markets for the Australian blackberry and raspberry industry as Hong Kong, Singapore, The United Arab Emirates and Canada. The strongest short-term trade options identified for the strawberry sector were Thailand, Malaysia, New Zealand and Macau.\n",
            "The strategy focuses heavily on growing the existing strawberry export market from 4 per cent to at least 8 per cent of national production by volume, in markets with a capacity and willingness to pay a premium for quality fruit. For raspberries and blackberries, the sectors aim to achieve a 5 per cent boost in exports assessed by volume across identified markets by 2021.\n",
            "Tasmanian raspberry exporter Nic Hansen said Australia offers some of the sweetest and most attractive berries in the world, and this combined with our stringent food safety standards across all stages of the supply chain puts growers in a solid position.\n",
            "“We have a great product, we are hungry to expand trade and now with this new plan in place, we have a clear roadmap towards driving growth,” Mr Hansen said.\n",
            "He said it is exciting to see new export market prospects for raspberries: “The more options we have for export the better. Now we just have to get on with the job of ensuring industry has all the tools it needs, such as supporting data and relationship building opportunities, to thrive in new markets.”\n",
            "This project was commissioned by Hort Innovation, and developed by market analysts and research consultants Auspex Strategic Advisory and AgInfinity. Hort Innovation will work now with berry sectors to determine levy-funded activities to support trade.\n",
            "See a summary of the strategy on the Hort Innovation website.\n",
